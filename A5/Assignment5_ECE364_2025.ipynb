        "As discussed, some of the most commonly used methods to avoid overﬁtting in neural networks are early stopping and dropout. The approach to avoiding overﬁtting by modifying the learning algorithm in order to generate models that are stable with respect to changes in the input is generally known as **regularization**\n",

        "**L2 regularization**, also known as weight decay, is a technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights. The `alpha` parameter in scikit-learn's MLPClassifier controls the strength of this L2 regularization.\n",
