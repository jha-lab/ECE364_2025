# ECE 364: Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics

Welcome to ECE 364! In this course we present basic concepts in machine learning for predictive data analytics:
* **Information-based learning:** decision trees; Shannon‚Äôs entropy model; information gain; ID3 algorithm; feature selection; predicting continuous targets; tree pruning; model ensembles: boosting, bagging.
* **Similarity-based learning:** feature spac, distance metrics, nearest neighbor algorithm, noisy data, predicting continuous targets, various measures of similarity, feature selection.
* **Probability-based learning:** Bayes' theorem; Bayesian prediction; curse of dimensionality; conditional independence and factorization; Naive Bayes model; smoothing; continuous features: probability density functions, binning; Bayesian networks. 
* **Error-based learning:**  simple linear regression; error surface; multivariate linear regression; gradient descent; learning rate; handling categorical features; modeling nonlinear relationships; multinomial logistic regression; support vector machines.
* **Deep learning:** artificial neural networks; activation functions; backpropagation and gradient descent; vanishing gradients; weight initialization; categorical target features: softmax layer and cross-entropy loss; dropout.
* **Evaluation:** misclassification rate; confusion matrix: precision, recall, F1 measure, profit/loss; prediction scores: receiver operating characteristic curve, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, gain/lift; measures of error; evaluating models after deployment.
* **The art of machine learning:** perspectives on prediction models: parametric vs. nonparametric, generative vs. discriminative; choosing a machine learning approach: no free lunch theorem, project requirements, data considerations.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Assignment Requirements

Each assignment in this course consists of two components: a **theoretical section** and a **programming section**.  

- **Theoretical Section**  
  It is recommended that you prepare all theoretical submissions in **LaTeX**. A template and a step-by-step tutorial are available in the `/docs` directory:  
  - Template: `/docs/template.tex`  
  - Tutorial: `/docs/Working with LaTeX.pdf`  

- **Programming Section**  
  For programming tasks, you are encouraged to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), especially if you are unable to run the code locally. Detailed instructions on using Colab can be found here:  
  - `/docs/Working with Google Colab.pdf`
  - **[One-minute Tutorial]**(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ANaoLv6HWze6RLm1Fvsv8qpHpM4GZGQb/view?usp=drive_link)  

For additional guidelines, please refer to:
